[Test File Link to the Failure-Inducing Input](https://github.com/pgrimaldo03/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-file.md)

(Add ss of symptom)

The failure-inducing input was the extra space that was after the links. The symptom as shown above was the result of this input, there was no more storage for the loop to keep running so it created the error. All this was because of the bug of having an extra line at the end of the test case.
