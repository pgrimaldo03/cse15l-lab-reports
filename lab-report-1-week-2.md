# Week 2 Lab Report

## Installing Visual Studio Code

To begin with I had to setup [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I downloaded the Windows version because I have a PC. I had already downloaded VS Code before so I skipped this step. 

Once I downloaded VS Code my screen looked like this:

## Remotely Connecting
To remote connect, I first had to install a program called OpenSHH (this step was required for me because I am on Windows). The steps can be found here: 

[Install OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)

For CSE 15L we have an account that I looked up here:
