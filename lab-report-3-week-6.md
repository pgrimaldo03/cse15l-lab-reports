# Week 6 Lab Report

## Streamlining ssh Configuration
First, I ran `~/.ssh/config` and I opened it up in VS Code. I switched the Host name from `ieng.ucsd.edu` to `ieng6`. This is the alias that I had set.

Then, I ran the command `ssh ieng6` that logged me into the correct account becuase `ieng6` was the alias for the Host name.

Lastly, I added the `Yes.txt` file to my ieng6 account by running `scp Yes.txt ieng6:~/`.

## Setup Github Access from ieng6
This part was confusing and I couldn't figure it out.

## Copy whole directories with `scp -r`
Same with this.
